-- Experiments Sorted by Topic --

-- Mechanics
- gravity, free fall [6]
- pendulum/ coupled pendulum [7], [11]
- friction/ slope: let the phone slide down a slope and use the accelerometer to measure x,y,z acceleration and use this values to draw the forces on the phone. Learning experience: understand the "force arrows"
- centrifugal force [8] 

-- Optics
- diffraction grading [3]

-- Sound
- interfering two sounds [3], [1], [9]
- Doppler shift [3]
- sound in vacuum [10]


--Ideas for Lab 160 --

Experiment 1, Walking
1) measure period T of the leg swing using the accelerometer (e.g. fixing it at the experimenter's shoe)
2) measuring T during a normal walk and compare the times
3) alternatively use the camera to measure T

Experiment 2, Speed of Sound
1) using two parabolic reflectors placed opposite of each other
2) placing the phone in the focus of the first reflector
3) producing a sound (which frequency length?, let the experimenter modulate the sound to find the frequency yielding the best results?)
4) measure two responses a) the sound when sending the signal b) the reflected sound wave. Hopefully, the microphone latency in the phone is constant so we don't have to worry about differences receiving latencies.
5) Doppler shift see [3]
6) interfering different tones [3,9]

Experiment 3, Resistance and Ohm’s Law

-- Other Ideas --

Measure SHM:
Fix spring on a force sensing resistor:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force-sensing_resistor
Possible usage: Use the force sensing resistor in a tone generator to change the tone frequency depending on the pendulum oscillation. Use the phone microphone to measure period T.

Touchscreen as detector?
- is there a ball that has the right capacity and can bounce on the tablet? -> measure gravity
- force sensing detector? -> measure pressure on the touchscreen, e.g. to measure fluid resistance?

Magnetometer?
http://www.sensorplatforms.com/understanding-smart-phone-sensor-performance-magnetometer-2/
measure magnetic field depending on sensor position. Hall effect...


-- Ideas for the Software --

- Basically like tracker but generalize it to more data sources other than just a series of pictures (movie).
- Be able to record a series of experiments. In each experiment a 2D dataset is taken, e.g, accelerator value vs. time, sound vs. time. This also includes movies, i.e., series of 2D pictures.
- Be able to mark points in each experiment and plot these point for the whole series.
- The experimenter is able to choose what sensors to use for a series.
